# New York Carver Society Website

This project recreates the website for the New York Carver Society, an affiliated association of the New York Records Department. The primary goal was to modernize and optimize the site's maintenance, achieving a significant reduction in costs.

## Project Features

- **Frontend**: Built using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript for a responsive and modern user experience.
- **Backend**: Implemented using Python and Jinja2 for managing dynamic templates.
- **Integrated Services**:
  - **BailSale**: Web hosting.
  - **EmailJS**: Automates email notifications.
  - **PayPal**: Payment system integration for seamless transactions.

## Collaboration with IT and Human Resources

I worked closely with both the IT and Human Resources teams to solve issues, attend meetings, exchange ideas, and resolve optimization challenges. This collaboration showcases my ability to work efficiently in a team environment, accept feedback, and contribute to ongoing improvements in the project.

## Cost Efficiency

The previous website had a maintenance cost of approximately $2,500 per year, including $300-$400 for hosting on Squarespace. The prior payment system also charged 25% on all transactions, which was highly inefficient. By switching to PayPal, which charges 3% plus $0.50 per transaction, and moving to a new hosting service, we were able to reduce the total cost to about $5 per year, covering mainly the domain name.

## Final Product
