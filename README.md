# New York Carver Society Website

This project recreates the website for the New York Carver Society, an affiliated association of the New York Records Department. The primary goal was to modernize and optimize the site's maintenance, achieving a significant reduction in costs.

## Project Features

- **Frontend**: Built using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript for a responsive and modern user experience.
- **Backend**: Implemented using Python and Jinja2 for managing dynamic templates.
- **Integrated Services**:
  - **EmailJS**: Automates email notifications.
  - **Vercel**: Continuous deployment and hosting.
  - **PayPal**: Payment system integration for seamless transactions.

## Cost Efficiency

The new setup reduced the website's maintenance cost from approximately $2,400-$2,500 per year to about $5 per year (mainly for domain name costs).
